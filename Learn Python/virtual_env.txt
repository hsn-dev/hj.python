''' 
Virtual Environment
	virtualenv is a way that you can seperate different python environments for different projects.
	virtualenv allows us to create different python environments so that every project has its own dependencies and packages and the specific versions they needed.

'''

pip install virtualenv
mkdir Environments
cd Environments
virtualenv project1_env          (create virutal env)
source project1_env/bin/activate (activate new python env)
which python                     (to check current env)
deactivate						 (to exit virtual env)

pip freeze --local > requirements.txt (to export packages to other env)

virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.6 py26_env
source py26_env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txts
